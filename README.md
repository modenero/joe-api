> As the submission deadline for the Moralis + Avalanche hackathon has long passed, I'm not expecting this to qualify for any prizes. However, it is my intention to __build strong & long lasting relationships with the organizers, sponsors, investors and especially the DeFi platforms of this EPIC event.__ I would greatly appreciate consideration from the team @ Trader Joe for ANY possible future collaborations, based on the work that will be performed in this repository over the next few days and weeks. ðŸ’ª  
Cheers!
