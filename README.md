> As the submission deadline for the Moralis + Avalanche hackathon has long passed, I'm not expecting this to qualify for any prizes. However, it is my intention to __build strong & long lasting relationships with the organizers, sponsors, investors and especially the DeFi platforms of this EPIC event.__ I would greatly appreciate consideration from the team @ Trader Joe for ANY possible future collaborations, based on the work that will be performed in this repository over the next few days and weeks. ðŸ’ª  
Cheers!

## Endpoints (Extended)

> Trader Joe is looking for a new capable API. The prize pool, which encourages a __"TVL, APR & APY API for All Pools, Farms and Lending Markets on Trader Joe",__ also totals $30,000. Right now, Trader Joeâ€™s TVL, APR, and APY are all calculated on the frontend. Trader Joe is looking for a solution to move this to a backend, which can be accessed by the frontend via an API.
